# AWS and AWS IoT Core services that interact Fleet Hub for AWS IoT Device Management<a name="aws-iot-monitor-admin-services-interact"></a>

This topic explains how the features in Fleet Hub for AWS IoT Device Management interact with other AWS services to deliver the capabilities in your Fleet Hub web applications\.

The following table indicates what AWS services Fleet Hub for AWS IoT Device Management uses to implement each feature\.


| Capability | AWS service | Description | 
| --- | --- | --- | 
| Integrate existing identity systems, such as Active Directory\. | AWS IAM Identity Center \(successor to AWS Single Sign\-On\) \(IAM Identity Center\) | You add users from your existing identity system by setting up AWS IAM Identity Center \(successor to AWS Single Sign\-On\) \(IAM Identity Center\) for your account\. You can connect your own identity provider to IAM Identity Center\. For more information, see [What Is AWS IAM Identity Center \(successor to AWS Single Sign\-On\)?](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/singlesignon/latest/userguide/) and [Workforce identities](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/singlesignon/latest/userguide/identities.html)\. | 
| Create queries by using AWS\-managed and custom fields\. | AWS IoT fleet indexing | Use the fleet indexing service to index, search, and aggregate your registry data, shadow data, and device connectivity data \(device lifecycle events\)\. You can also create custom fields in addition to the managed fields that AWS IoT Core fleet indexing indexes by default\. For more information about fleet indexing, see [Fleet indexing](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/iot-indexing.html)\. | 
| Create alarms for a set of devices specified by a query\. | Amazon CloudWatch \(CloudWatch\) | Fleet Hub dashboards expose CloudWatch metrics that you can use in combination with searchable fields to create alarming thresholds\. For example, you can create CloudWatch alarm that generates an Amazon Simple Notification Service \(Amazon SNS\) notification whenever the number of connected devices falls beneath a specified quantity\. For information about CloudWatch, see [What Is Amazon CloudWatch?](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/) For information about how AWS IoT Core works with CloudWatch to create metrics and alarms, see [Monitor AWS IoT alarms and metrics using CloudWatch](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/monitoring-cloudwatch.html)\. |
