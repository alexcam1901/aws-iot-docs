# Managing fleet metrics<a name="managing-fleet-metrics"></a>

This topic shows how to use the AWS IoT console and AWS CLI to manage your fleet metrics\. 

## Managing fleet metrics \(Console\)<a name="managing-fleet-metrics-console"></a>

Make sure you've enabled fleet indexing with associated data sources and configurations before creating fleet metrics\.

### Enable fleet indexing<a name="setup-steps-console"></a>

If you've already enabled fleet indexing, skip this section\.

If you haven't enabled fleet indexing, follow these instructions\.

1. Open your AWS IoT console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/iot/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iot/)\.

1. On the AWS IoT menu, choose **Settings**\. 

1. To view the detailed settings, on the **Settings** page, scroll down to the **Fleet indexing** section\.

1. To update your fleet indexing settings, to the right of the **Fleet indexing** section, select **Manage indexing**\. 

1. On the **Manage fleet indexing** page, update your fleet indexing settings based on your needs\. 
   + **Configuration**

     To turn on thing indexing, toggle **Thing indexing** on, and then select the data sources you want to index from\. 

     To turn on thing group indexing, toggle **Thing group indexing** on\.
   + **Custom fields for aggregation \- *optional***

     Custom fields are a list of field name and field type pairs\. 

     To add a custom field pair, choose **Add new field**\. Enter a custom field name such as `attributes.temperature`, then select a field type from the **Field type** menu\. Note that a custom field name begins with `attributes.` and will be saved as an attribute to run [thing aggregations queries](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/index-aggregate.html)\.

     To update and save the setting, choose **Update**\.

### Create a fleet metric<a name="create-fleet-metrics-console"></a>

1. Open your AWS IoT console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/iot/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iot/)\. 

1. On the AWS IoT menu, choose **Manage**, and then choose **Fleet metrics**\.

1. On the **Fleet metrics** page, choose **Create fleet metric** and complete the creation steps\.

1. In step 1 **Configure fleet metrics**
   + In **Query** section, enter a query string to specify the things or thing groups you want to perform the aggregate search\. The query string consists of an attribute and a value\. For **Properties**, choose the attribute you want, or, if it doesn't appear in the list, enter the attribute in the field\. Enter the value after `:`\. An example query string can be `thingName:TempSensor*`\. For each query string you enter, press **enter** in your keyboard\. If you enter multiple query strings, specify their relationship by selecting **and**, **or**, **and not**, or **or not** between them\. 
   + In **Report properties**, choose **Index name**, **Aggregation type**, and **Aggregation field** from their respective lists\. Next, select the data you want to aggregate in **Select data**, where you can select multiple data values\.
   + Choose **Next**\.

1. In step 2 **Specify fleet metric properties**
   + In **Fleet metric name** field, enter a name for the fleet metric you're creating\.
   + In **Description \- *optional*** field, enter a description for the fleet metric you're creating\. This field is optional\. 
   + In **Hours** and **Minutes** fields, enter the time \(how often\) you want the fleet metric to emit data to CloudWatch\.
   + Choose **Next**\.

1. In step 3 **Review and create**
   + Review the settings of step 1 and step 2\. To edit the settings, choose **Edit**\.
   + Choose **Create fleet metric**\.

After successful creation, the fleet metric is listed on the **Fleet metric** page\.

### Update a fleet metric<a name="update-fleet-metrics-console"></a>

1. On the **Fleet metric** page, choose the fleet metric you want to update\.

1. On the fleet metric **Details** page, choose **Edit**\. This opens the creation steps where you can update your fleet metric in any of the three steps\. 

1. After you finish updating the fleet metric, choose **Update fleet metric**\.

### Delete a fleet metric<a name="delete-fleet-metrics-console"></a>

1. On the **Fleet metric** page, choose the fleet metric you want to delete\.

1. On the next page that shows details of your fleet metric, choose **Delete**\.

1. In the dialog box, enter the name of your fleet metric to confirm deletion\.

1. Choose **Delete**\. This step deletes your fleet metric permanently\.

## Managing fleet metrics \(CLI\)<a name="managing-fleet-metrics-cli"></a>

The following sections show how to use the AWS CLI to manage your fleet metrics\. Make sure you've enabled fleet indexing with associated data sources and configurations before creating fleet metrics\. To enable fleet indexing for your things or thing groups, follow the instructions in [Managing thing indexing](managing-index.md#enable-index) or [Managing thing group indexing](thinggroup-index.md#enable-group-index)\.

### Create a fleet metric<a name="create-fleet-metrics"></a>

You use the create\-fleet\-metric CLI command to create a fleet metric\. 

```
aws iot create-fleet-metric --metric-name "YourFleetMetricName" --query-string "*" --period 60 --aggregation-field "registry.version" --aggregation-type name=Statistics,values=sum
```

The output of this command contains the name and Amazon Resource Name \(ARN\) of your fleet metric\. The output looks like the following:

```
{
    "metricArn": "arn:aws:iot:us-east-1:111122223333:fleetmetric/YourFleetMetricName", 
    "metricName": "YourFleetMetricName"
}
```

### List fleet metrics<a name="list-fleet-metrics"></a>

You use the list\-fleet\-metric CLI command to list all the fleet metrics in your account\. 

```
aws iot list-fleet-metrics
```

The output of this command contains all your fleet metrics\. The output looks like the following:

```
{
    "fleetMetrics": [
        {
            "metricArn": "arn:aws:iot:us-east-1:111122223333:fleetmetric/YourFleetMetric1", 
            "metricName": "YourFleetMetric1"
        }, 
        {
            "metricArn": "arn:aws:iot:us-east-1:111122223333:fleetmetric/YourFleetMetric2", 
            "metricName": "YourFleetMetric2"
        }
    ]
}
```

### Describe a fleet metric<a name="describe-fleet-metrics"></a>

You use the describe\-fleet\-metric CLI command to display more detailed information about a fleet metric\. 

```
aws iot describe-fleet-metric --metric-name "YourFleetMetricName"
```

The output of command contains the detailed information about the specified fleet metric\. The output looks like the following:

```
{
    "queryVersion": "2017-09-30", 
    "lastModifiedDate": 1625790642.355, 
    "queryString": "*", 
    "period": 60, 
    "metricArn": "arn:aws:iot:us-east-1:111122223333:fleetmetric/YourFleetMetricName", 
    "aggregationField": "registry.version", 
    "version": 1, 
    "aggregationType": {
        "values": [
            "sum"
        ], 
        "name": "Statistics"
    }, 
    "indexName": "AWS_Things", 
    "creationDate": 1625790642.355, 
    "metricName": "YourFleetMetricName"
}
```

### Update a fleet metric<a name="update-fleet-metrics"></a>

You use the update\-fleet\-metric CLI command to update a fleet metric\. 

```
aws iot update-fleet-metric --metric-name "YourFleetMetricName" --query-string "*" --period 120 --aggregation-field "registry.version" --aggregation-type name=Statistics,values=sum,count --index-name AWS_Things
```

The update\-fleet\-metric command doesn't produce any output\. You can use the describe\-fleet\-metric CLI command to see the result\.

```
{
    "queryVersion": "2017-09-30", 
    "lastModifiedDate": 1625792300.881, 
    "queryString": "*", 
    "period": 120, 
    "metricArn": "arn:aws:iot:us-east-1:111122223333:fleetmetric/YourFleetMetricName", 
    "aggregationField": "registry.version", 
    "version": 2, 
    "aggregationType": {
        "values": [
            "sum", 
            "count"
        ], 
        "name": "Statistics"
    }, 
    "indexName": "AWS_Things", 
    "creationDate": 1625792300.881, 
    "metricName": "YourFleetMetricName"
}
```

### Delete a fleet metric<a name="delete-fleet-metrics"></a>

You use the delete\-fleet\-metric CLI command to delete a fleet metric\. 

```
aws iot delete-fleet-metric --metric-name "YourFleetMetricName"
```

This command doesn't produce any output if the deletion is successful or if you specify a fleet metric that doesn't exist\.
