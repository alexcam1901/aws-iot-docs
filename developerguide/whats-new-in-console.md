# What's new in the AWS IoT console<a name="whats-new-in-console"></a>

We're in the process of updating the user interface of the AWS IoT console to a new experience\. We're updating the user interface in stages, so some pages in the console will have a new experience, some might have both the original and the new experience, and some might have only the original experience\. 

 This table displays the state of individual areas of the AWS IoT console user interface as of January 27, 2022\.
