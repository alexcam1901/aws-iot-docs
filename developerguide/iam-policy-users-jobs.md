# Authorizing users and cloud services to use AWS IoT Jobs<a name="iam-policy-users-jobs"></a>

To authorize your users and cloud services, you must use IAM policies on both the control plane and data plane\. The policies must be used with HTTPS protocol and must use AWS Signature Version 4 authentication \(port 443\) to authenticate users\.

**Note**  
AWS IoT Core policies must not be used on the control plane\. Only IAM policies are used for authorizing users or Cloud Services\. For more information about using the required policy type, see [Required policy type for AWS IoT Jobs](iot-jobs-security.md#jobs-required-policy)\.

IAM policies are JSON documents that contain policy statements\. Policy statements use *Effect*, *Action*, and *Resource* elements to specify resources, allowed or denied actions, and conditions under which actions are allowed or denied\. For more information, see [IAM JSON Policy Elements Reference](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/service-authorization/latest/reference/reference_policies_elements.html) in the *IAM User Guide*\.

**Warning**  
We recommend that you don't use wildcard permissions, such as `"Action": ["iot:*"]` in your IAM policies or AWS IoT Core policies\. Using wildcard permissions is not a recommended security best practice\. For more information, see [AWS IoT policies overly permissive](audit-chk-iot-policy-permissive.md)\. 

## IAM policies on the control plane<a name="iam-jobs-control-plane"></a>

On the control plane, IAM policies use the `iot:` prefix with the action to authorize the corresponding jobs API operation\. For example the `iot:CreateJob` policy action grants the user permission to use the [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/apireference/API_CreateJob.html](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/apireference/API_CreateJob.html) API\.

### Policy actions<a name="iam-control-plane-actions"></a>

The following table shows a list of IAM policy actions and permissions to use the API actions\. For information about resource types, see [Resource types defined by AWS IoT](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/service-authorization/latest/reference/list_awsiot.html#awsiot-job)\. For more information about AWS IoT actions, see [Actions defined by AWS IoT](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/service-authorization/latest/reference/list_awsiot.html)\.

### Basic IAM policy example<a name="iam-control-plane-example"></a>

The following shows an example of an IAM policy that allows the user permission to perform the following actions for your IoT thing and thing group\. 

In the example, replace:
+ *region* with your AWS Region, such as `us-east-1`\.
+ *account\-id* with your AWS account number, such as `57EXAMPLE833`\.
+ *thing\-group\-name* with the name of your IoT thing group for which you're targeting jobs, such as `FirmwareUpdateGroup`\.
+ *thing\-name* with the name of your IoT thing for which you're targeting jobs, such as `MyIoTThing`\.

```
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Action": [
                "iot:CreateJobTemplate",
                "iot:CreateJob",
                ],
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Resource": "arn:aws:iot:region:account-id:thinggroup/thing-group-name"
        },
        {
            "Action": [
                "iot:DescribeJob",
                "iot:CancelJob",
                "iot:DeleteJob",
            ],
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Resource": "arn:aws:iot:region:account-id:job/*"
        },
        {
            "Action": [
                "iot:DescribeJobExecution",
                "iot:CancelJobExecution",
                "iot:DeleteJobExecution",
            ],
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Resource": [

                "arn:aws:iot:region:account-id:job/*"
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```

### IAM policy example for IP based authorization<a name="iam-control-plane-example1"></a>

You can restrict *principals* from making API calls to your control plane endpoint from specific IP addresses\. To specify the IP addresses that can be allowed, in the Condition element of your IAM policy, use the [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_policies_condition-keys.html#condition-keys-sourceip](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_policies_condition-keys.html#condition-keys-sourceip) global condition key\. 

Using this condition key can also deny access to other AWS services from making these API calls on your behalf, such as AWS CloudFormation\. To allow access to these services, use the [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_policies_condition-keys.html#condition-keys-viaawsservice](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_policies_condition-keys.html#condition-keys-viaawsservice) global condition key with the aws:SourceIp key\. This ensures that the source IP address access restriction applies only to requests that are made directly by a principal\. For more information, see [AWS: Denies access to AWS based on the source IP](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_policies_examples_aws_deny-ip.html)\.

The following example shows how to allow only a specific IP address that can make API calls to the control plane endpoint\. The `aws:ViaAWSService` key is set to `true`, which allows other services to make API calls on your behalf\. 

```
{            
   "Version": "2012-10-17",
   "Statement": [
       {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "iot:CreateJobTemplate",
                "iot:CreateJob"
             ],
            "Resource": ["*"],
            "Condition": {
                "IpAddress": {
                    "aws:SourceIp": "123.45.167.89"
                }
            },            
            "Bool": {"aws:ViaAWSService": "true"}
        }
    ],
}
```

## IAM policies on the data plane<a name="iam-jobs-data-plane"></a>

IAM policies on the data plane use the `iotjobsdata:` prefix to authorize jobs API operations that users can perform\. On the data plane, you can grant a user permission to use the [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/apireference/API_iot-jobs-data_DescribeJobExecution.html](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/apireference/API_iot-jobs-data_DescribeJobExecution.html) API by using the `iotjobsdata:DescribeJobExecution` policy action\.

**Warning**  
Using IAM policies on the data plane is not recommended when targeting AWS IoT Jobs for your devices\. We recommend that you use IAM policies on the control plane for users to create and manage jobs\. On the data plane, for authorizing devices to retrieve job executions and update the execution status, use [AWS IoT Core policies for HTTPS protocol](iot-data-plane-jobs.md#iot-jobs-data-http)\.

### Basic IAM policy example<a name="iam-data-plane-example"></a>

The API operations that must be authorized are usually performed by a user typing CLI commands\. The following shows an example of a user performing a `DescribeJobExecution` operation\.

In the example, replace:
+ *region* with your AWS Region, such as `us-east-1`\.
+ *account\-id* with your AWS account number, such as `57EXAMPLE833`\.
+ *thing\-name* with the name of your IoT thing for which you're targeting jobs, such as `myRegisteredThing`\.
+ `job-id` is the unique identifier for the job that's targeted using the API\.

```
aws iot-jobs-data describe-job-execution \ 
    --endpoint-url "https://account-id.jobs.iot.region.amazonaws.com" \ 
    --job-id jobID --thing-name thing-name
```

The following shows a sample IAM policy that authorizes this action:

```
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": 
    {
        "Action": ["iotjobsdata:DescribeJobExecution"],
        "Effect": "Allow",
        "Resource": "arn:aws:iot:region:account-id:thing/thing-name",
    }
   }
```

            "Condition": {
                "IpAddress": {
                    "aws:SourceIp": "123.45.167.89"
                }
            },            
            "Bool": {"aws:ViaAWSService": "false"}
        }
    ],
}
```

       {
            "Effect": "Deny",
            "Action": ["iotjobsdata:*"],
            "Condition": {
                "IpAddress": {
                    "aws:SourceIp": [

### IAM policy example for both control plane and data plane<a name="iam-data-plane-example2"></a>

If a user performs an API operation on both the control plane and data plane, your control plane policy action must use the `iot:` prefix, and your data plane policy action must use the `iotjobsdata:` prefix\. 

For example, the `DescribeJobExecution` API can be used in both the control plane and data plane\. On the control plane, the [DescribeJobExecution](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/apireference/API_DescribeJobExecution.html) API is used to describe a job execution\. On the data plane, the [ DescribeJobExecution](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/apireference/API_iot-jobs-data_DescribeJobExecution.html) API is used to get details of a job execution\.

The following IAM policy authorizes a user permission to use the `DescribeJobExecution` API on both the control plane and data plane\.

In the example, replace:
+ *region* with your AWS Region, such as `us-east-1`\.
+ *account\-id* with your AWS account number, such as `57EXAMPLE833`\.
+ *thing\-name* with the name of your IoT thing for which you're targeting jobs, such as `MyIoTThing`\.

```
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Action": ["iotjobsdata:DescribeJobExecution"],
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Resource": "arn:aws:iot:region:account-id:thing/thing-name"
        },
        {
            "Action": [
                "iot:DescribeJobExecution",
                "iot:CancelJobExecution",
                "iot:DeleteJobExecution",
            ],
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Resource": [
                "arn:aws:iot:region:account-id:thing/thing-name"
                "arn:aws:iot:region:account-id:job/*"
            ]
        }
    ]            
}
```

## Authorize tagging of IoT resources<a name="tagging-iot-jobs"></a>

For better control over jobs and job templates that a user can create, modify, or use, you can attach tags to the jobs or job templates\. Tags also help you discern ownership and assign and allocate costs by placing them in billing groups and attaching tags to them\.

When a user wants to tag their jobs or job templates that they created by using the AWS Management Console or the AWS CLI, your IAM policy must grant the user permissions to tag them\. To grant permissions, your IAM policy must use the `iot:TagResource` action\.

For general information about tagging your resources, see [Tagging your AWS IoT resources](tagging-iot.md)\.

### IAM policy example<a name="iam-jobs-tags-example"></a>

For an example that shows how to grant tagging permissions, consider a user that runs the following command to create a job and tag it to a specific environment\.

In the example, replace:
+ *region* with your AWS Region, such as `us-east-1`\.
+ *account\-id* with your AWS account number, such as `57EXAMPLE833`\.
+ *thing\-name* with the name of your IoT thing for which you're targeting jobs, such as `MyIoTThing`\.

```
aws iot create-job 
    --job-id test_job 
    --targets "arn:aws:iot:region:account-id:thing/thingOne"
    --document-source "https://s3.amazonaws.com/my-s3-bucket/job-document.json"
    --description "test job description" 
    --tags Key=environment,Value=beta
```

For this example, you must use the following IAM policy:

```
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": 
    {
        "Action": [ "iot:CreateJob", "iot:CreateJobTemplate", "iot:TagResource" ],
        "Effect": "Allow",
        "Resource": [
            "arn:aws:iot:aws-region:account-id:job/*",
            "arn:aws:iot:aws-region:account-id:jobtemplate/*"
        ]
    }
}
```
